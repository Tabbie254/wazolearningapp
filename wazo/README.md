## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or Yarn (v1 or higher)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wazo-frontend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd wazo-frontend
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Install the required npm packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   Alternatively, if you use Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL for your backend API.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000` (default port).

- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `npm test` or `yarn test`: Runs the test suite.

- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.

- `npm run format` or `yarn format`: Formats the codebase using Prettier.

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. To build the application for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

   This will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` directory.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project structure:

- `public/`
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file.
  - `assets/`: Static assets such as images and fonts.

- `src/`
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `pages/`: Page components representing different routes.
  - `services/`: API service functions for communicating with the backend.
  - `context/`: React Context for global state management.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `App.js`: Main application component with routing.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
  - `App.css`: Global styles.

## Development

### Code Style

- **Linting**: Use ESLint to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier to format the codebase.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for components and services using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Running Tests**: Use `npm test` or `yarn test` to run tests.

### Routing

- The application uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing. Check `App.js` for route configurations.

### State Management

- React Context API is used for managing global state, such as user authentication.

## Deployment

### Building for Production

1. Build the app:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. The built app will be located in the `build` directory. You can deploy these static files to any static file hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

### Environment Variables

Ensure that environment variables for production are set correctly in your deployment environment.
