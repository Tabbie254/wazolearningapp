## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the backend service on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- MySQL (or any other preferred SQL database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wazo.git
    cd wazo/backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your database and configure the connection settings in `.env` file.

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=wazoschema
PORT=5000
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual database configuration.

### Database Setup

Run the following command to initialize your database schema:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

If you need to seed the database with initial data, run:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

## Running the Application

To start the server in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file (default is 5000).

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the main API endpoints available in this backend service:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/quiz` - Fetch all quizzes
- `GET /api/quiz/:id` - Fetch a single quiz by ID
